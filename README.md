# ACESO
SheHacks Project


To manage the inconvenience caused due to delay in ambulance services and response time, we have come up with Aceso, a simple website which bridges the gap between patients and medical aids.
•	The user has to create an account on Aceso by filling up the minimal details first.
•	 There is provision to add the necessary legal documents like Aadhar Card, Voter ID etc as well as their medical information like previous medical history, known allergies, blood group etc which will act as Electronic Health Record and which can be accessed by the medical authorities immediately and will save the time used in filling up these details manually upon arrival at the hospital. 
•	The list of nearest hospitals with the facilities available can be accessed by the user through the website. 
•	The user can contact the hospital using the contact information or can directly make an appointment or call for an ambulance through the website in case of emergency. 
•	Along with details of hospitals, details of verified doctors and specialists will also be made available. 
•	The website also ensures safe online payment. 
•	The user can also check the availability of medicines in the nearest medical stores from his location and can also order them directly from the website.
 
FUTURE WORK:
We would like to improvise our project in the near future by working on the following features:
•	Aceso mobile application which will be more user friendly.
•	Improve the accuracy of maps

CHALLENGES WE RAN INTO:
The major challenge was the time constraint and working on a real-time website for the first time. It was difficult to implement to work with Google Maps API and we’ve tried our best to implement our idea to the best of our knowledge.
